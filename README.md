COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
📌 Project Description
The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a data analysis project built with Python. It tracks and visualizes global COVID-19 trends, including total cases, deaths, new infections, and vaccinations across different countries and over time. The project leverages data from Our World in Data to provide insights into the progression of the pandemic worldwide.

🎯 Project Objectives
✅ Import and clean real-world COVID-19 data

✅ Analyze time-series trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)

✅ Compare key metrics across countries/regions

✅ Visualize trends using charts and graphs

✅ Communicate insights in a structured Jupyter Notebook

🧰 Tools and Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

(Optional) Plotly / Geopandas for map visualizations

🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID19-Global-Data-Tracker.git
cd COVID19-Global-Data-Tracker
Download the Dataset:

Download owid-covid-data.csv from Our World in Data.

Save it in the same directory as the notebook.

Open Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook COVID19_Global_Data_Tracker_ReadyToRun.ipynb
Run the Notebook:

Execute each cell from top to bottom to view analysis and visualizations.

📊 Visualizations Included
Line charts of total cases and deaths over time

Bar charts comparing cases across countries

Histogram of new daily cases

Scatter plots showing relationships between numerical metrics

Vaccination progress visualizations

🔍 Key Insights
Country-specific comparisons show varying trends in vaccination rollouts.

Daily new cases highlight the impact of waves and variants.

Death-to-case ratio provides insight into healthcare strain.

Some countries show remarkable vaccine progress within short timeframes.
